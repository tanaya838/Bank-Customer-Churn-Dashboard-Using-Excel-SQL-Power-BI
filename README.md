# Bank-Customer-Churn-Dashboard-Using-Excel-SQL-Power-BI

The main objective of the Bank Customer Churn Dashboard is to analyse customer churn and identify the key factors influencing customers to leave the bank. By visualizing customer behaviour across demographics, financial indicators, tenure, and product usage. The dashboard helps the bank monitor churn rates, discover churn drivers, and develop targeted actions to reduce attrition and improve customer satisfaction.

Tools & Technologies:

This project utilizes a combination of (Excel + SQL + Power BI) data handling, querying, and visualization tools to build a complete customer churn analysis solution.

1. Microsoft Excel:
   
•	Initial data cleaning and formatting

•	Handling missing values

•	Creating calculated fields

•	Basic exploratory data analysis

2. SQL (Structured Query Language):
   
•	Data extraction and querying

•	Aggregation and grouping of churn-related measures

•	Segmentation by demographic and financial attributes

•	Calculating churn rates across multiple dimensions

3. Microsoft Power BI:
   
•	Data Modelling

•	Relationship building between tables

•	Created calculated columns and DAX measures

•	Creating visual dashboards & reports

•	Visualization charts, KPIs, filters, and navigations

Data Source:

The dataset used for this dashboard is the Bank Customer Churn dataset, sourced from Maven Analytics.

It contains over 10,000 Customers, 2,037 Churned customers, 650.53 Average credit score, 20.37 Churn rate percentage, 76.46K Average balance.

Key Questions:

1.What is the distribution of customers by Geography (France, Spain, Germany) and how does churn vary across them?

2.Does gender have any significant impact on churn?

3.What is the average age of customers who churned vs. those who stayed?

4.Is there a difference in salary levels between churned and non-churned customers?

5.Do customers with more products have lower churn rates?

6.What is the churn rate for customers who own a credit card vs. those who don’t?

7.Does having an active membership reduce churn?

8.How does account balance influence churn probability?

9.What is the churn rate by tenure group (e.g., 0–2 years, 3–5 years, 6–10 years)?

10.Do customers with longer tenure show higher loyalty, or is churn evenly spread?

11.What is the average Credit Score of churned vs. retained customers?

12.Which group contributes more to lost revenue:

---High-salary churners

---Low-salary churners

13.If we assume churned customers = lost revenue, what is the total estimated salary lost due to churn?

Walkthrough of Key Visuals:

Slicers (Top Right & Top Left): Geography, Number of products, Gender, Age

Key KPIs (Top below Slicers): Total customers, Churned customers, Churn rate percentage, Average credit score & Average balance

Customer Status Distribution (Stacked Column Chart): It compares the distribution between Total customers, Churned customers & Non-churned customers

Churn rate Percentage By Balance Group (Donut Chart): Balance Group is grouped in High Balance (31.04%), Very High Balance (27.85%), Medium Balance (23.95%), Low Balance (17.16%)

Churn Rate Percentage By Tenure Group (Donut Chart): Tenure Group is grouped in New Customers (34.35%), Mid-tenure Customers (33.71%) & Long-tenure Customers (31.94%)

Churned Customers By Gender (Stacked Bar Chart): Female (1,139) & Male (898)

Churn Rate Percentage By Gender (Pie Chart): Female (60.37%) & Male (39.63%)

Churn Rate Percentage By Geography (Stacked Column Chart): Germany has the highest churn rate percentage by geography

Churn Rate Percentage By Credit Card (Pie Chart): Credit-card users are less likely to leave the bank, while Non–credit-card users are at higher churn risk. As a business solution encourage non–credit-card customers to adopt credit-card products through targeted offers or benefits to help reduce churn and improve retention.

This dashboard is designed to analyse and visualize customer churn trends to help businesses understand why customers leave and how retention can be improved. By segmenting customers based on factors such as credit card ownership, geography, tenure, account balance, and active membership, the dashboard highlights key patterns that differentiate churned and non-churned customers.

The goal is to provide a data-driven foundation for identifying at-risk customer groups, evaluating behavioural indicators, and supporting decisions that enhance customer satisfaction and reduce churn. These insights help stakeholders prioritize strategic actions, optimize resource allocation, and build impactful retention initiatives.
